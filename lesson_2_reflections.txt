*What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I am creating a place to store the various versions of my code to be
stored in git and github. This is the entire point of using something
like git in the first place. 

*How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
 What value do you think it offers?
This is a holding area, where you can bundle changes together or decide if they should
got together. 
It give another opertunity to have control over what will be stored in various 
versions. 

*How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
This a good place to keep changes on deck until you have reached a logical commit
point. 

*What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? 
 How would branches help?
They would be a great way of working on added features and then adding them to the master
code when read. That history would allow the coder to know if something went wrong and revert 
a past state while they figure it out.
