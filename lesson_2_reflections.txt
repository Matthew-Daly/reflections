*What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I am creating a place to store the various versions of my code to be
stored in git and github. This is the entire point of using something
like git in the first place. 

*How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
 What value do you think it offers?
This is a holding area, where you can bundle changes together or decide if they should
got together. 
It give another opertunity to have control over what will be stored in various 
versions.
